Review: Very well designed, fun to play around with everything clicks into place nicely. Only 3 flaws1. Knees would really benefit from a joint there to move around to do cool Optimus poses2. Wish he’d come with attachments like an Energon blaster or have the hands be removable and have an attachment for an energon axe3. Wish the eyes were a light blue like in most of optimus’ actual appearances.Otherwise perfect. Highly recommended

Review: Highly disappointed been looking at these for several months now for my grandson and I truly thought that this was The Real McCoy but it's not it doesn't do anything as far as asking it to do you have to do it yourself with very lame instructions on the box.
