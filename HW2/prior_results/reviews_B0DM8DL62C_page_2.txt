Review: Excellent light weight. The Men’s Wear house sells these same identical shoes at $160.00 I couldn’t believe that I found them on Amazon a great buy.

Review: Just like cole Cohan’s but they do squeak a little bite NOT SOUNDS but by FEELING the SQUEAKING until your break them in after a week or so. Other than that they’re awesome shoes I brought 2pairs 1 brown 1 black and still CHEAPER than 1 pair of COLE COHANS…I’m going to rebuy again really soon w/out a doubt

Review: Husband says they fit perfectly, so true to size. They look alright in person. I personally don't like the gray bottom, but that's just me. From top view, they look fine, so not bad shoes.I will say they do feel cheaply made, so not really sure how well they will hold up.
