Review: Amazing quality for the price! These shoes are super comfortable and I get compliments on them all day. Theyâ€™re versatile enough to wear with something casual or even a bit dressier. Definitely planning to grab the brown pair next!

Review: These are awesome shoes. I usually wear a 10.5 but had to return for a size 11.  If you purchase these shoes you will not regret the purchase. They feel great on your feet and look great too.

Review: There's a defect on the right shoe. I wouldn't have noticed except the shoes otherwise are PREFECT. It's a small frayed section on top of the shoe where the gray mesh meets the brown beading.Don't know how to rate this. The shoes are beautiful and very comfortable to wear. Just the frayed part.

Review: VERY THIN toe area. Each time I walk you can see my big toe poking up. That will rip/tear in no time at all. The fit seems spot on.

Review: My husband will pretty much only wear ugly tennis shoes because he walks so much at work. I bought him these because he needed something nicer than running shoes for dinner dates or a photoshoot. He said these were so comfortable I could buy more colors and he may even wear them to work. Love the way they look and they have not worn out yet after about 6 months of wear about 1-2 times a week.

Review: Comfortable and cool for summer wear, fabric is textured so it traps dust easily, keep the box to cover them when not wearing regularly.  Great for Garden Party where sneakers are too casual and dress shoes too formal.
