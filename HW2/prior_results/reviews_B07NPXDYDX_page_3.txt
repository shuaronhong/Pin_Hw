Review: These shoes are comfortable for the price. Just the right amount of cushioning, some shoes have too muchcushioning for me and feel like I’m bouncing. These are okay.

Review: These shoes are wonderful as a classic pair of flats. The suede gives them an elevated feel. The shoes fit a little narrower than most so be mindful of sizing if you tend to have a wider foot.

Review: Edited review: I bought a second pair in size 7 which fits better but I believe I could have gone down to a 6.5.  Don't size up!For a basic shoe, it's fine.  I'm a true 7 and I bought the 7.5 based on other reviews. I wish I had gotten a 7 instead, and definitely will if I repurchase.

Review: Im obsessed with these flats! They're so comfortable and stylish. I've worn them to work, to run errands, and even to a night out with friends. The quality is top-notch and they fit perfectly. I've been looking for a pair of flats that don't sacrifice style for comfort, and these deliver. Highly recommend.

Review: Well sadly I love these type of shoes but have bunions and this particular brand kind of irritated my left bunion area.  I ordered two different brands of identical shoes and these came in as 2nd place.  I still love them. Quality is nice for the money but I can’t wear them all day as they do start to hurt.

Review: I have these shoes in 5 colors and love them!! However, this pair has an issue - The left shoe is at least a half size, if not more, larger than the right.
