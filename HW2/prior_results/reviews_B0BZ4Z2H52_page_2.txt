Review: I really love this mattress! Itâ€™s super comfortable and soft, and I sleep so well on it every night. Since I started using it, my sleep has been deeper and more relaxing. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a good nightâ€™s rest

Review: its a pretty good bed, the head board is like soft, built perfectly, It doesn't really smell like anything, but I do recommend buying the mattress first because the bed will make some strange sounds from the wood things. Buy the mattress that you need first to have good sleep quality, its actually pretty sturdy which makes your sleep a lot better and yes overall its a great product will buy again

Review: Beautiful & easily assembled in an hour.Only issue is we keep kicking the metal foot under the sides of the bed.So that falls on both of us, klutzes & design flaw.The supports should be closer to the center as no one sleeps on the edge of the frame.

Review: Bed frame is nice & aesthetic after a while the boards underneath the mattress start to creak. Other wise itâ€™s a great bed.
