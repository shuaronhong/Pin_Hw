Review: Please be aware these run a half size too small.  I wear 10.5 and my toe is almost at the end.  When walking, with the natural flex of the shoes, my foot slides slightly forward and touches end.  I have ordered these in the past and they were true to size.  However, I ordered three different colors of these in April and may of 2025 and they are smaller.  Other than that, they are very comfortable shoes and of good quality.  Just be aware of sizing.

Review: Normally, I would have needed a wide fit shoe, but the standard size 11 I ordered fit fine. Really like them!

Review: We have purchased these in several colors - and our son loves them!  He is a teacher and on his feet all day.  He said they are comfortable and don't hurt his feet.  They are a dress/casual shoe.

Review: I have been wearing everyday since I bought a month and a half ago. They fit well, and are very comfortable for an office setting. I have walked a few miles on a hot day in them and I had no issue.

Review: Husband needed a casual pair of shoes for summer. Prime Day came and these were at a great price so I ordered him the brown. He really likes them. Says they're very comfortable and lightweight one is feet but still supportive. They seem to be good quality construction and durable. He's worn them many times already with shorts, pants and is happy with the fit and comfort. And, he's picky about shoes. Great value!
