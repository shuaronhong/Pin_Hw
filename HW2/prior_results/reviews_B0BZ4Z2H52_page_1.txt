Review: My husband and I thoroughly love our new bed! We have been searching around for a nice priced Queen size bed frame for a while and had our box spring and mattress on the floor for too long and we were tired of not having a bed frame because our other frame broke when we moved, so I went into deep search and found this amazing bed frame and the reviews sold me. We were looking for a bed that's not difficult to get up three flights of steps to our apartment and also we wanted something that was easy to put together. We were excited to receive our bed and it what's package nicely and my teenage son and husband brought it up the stairs with no problem with it weighing around 70lbs. It's made of great quality and very sturdy and heavy duty.We love the cushioned thickness of the headboard, it's very nice color that matches our decor, it's also very sturdy with no noise and very comfortable! Took us about an hour to put it together with the easy instructions, also my husband's and I together combined weight is about 500 lbs and it held us perfectly with no problems and we woke up feeling refreshed and all of our body aches were gone the moment we climbed into our bed! We absolutely love it and I will be ordering another one for our guest bedroom once we move into our new home! Thank you for creating such a nice, beautiful, quality, easy, and affordable bed frame!

Review: This bed fits well in a small room and has a good height for easy use. Assembly was straightforward and the frame feels sturdy overall. The headboard is a bit on the flimsy side, but still decent for the price. I like that it doesn‚Äôt squeak and supports the mattress well without a box spring. For the cost, it‚Äôs a good balance of function and style.

Review: First off, I wouldn‚Äôt call the color Navy Blue.. it‚Äôs more denim blue but still nice.. ¬†It‚Äôs a very sturdy bed, all metal frame and solid wood slats with Velcro to hold them in place.. ¬†There are no staples visible with the upholstery fabric, headboard fabric is very nice. Feels great. ¬†This bed frame presents itself as a much more expensive bed.. Assembly wasn‚Äôt too bad unfortunately the instructions were cut and missing half the pages.. overall it looks great and very sturdy and the price is awesome .. I would recommend it!

Review: Let's start with shipping. Original ETA was about a week out for a Tue but instead it arrived three days earlier on a Sat. That was a very nice surprise.The bed is super simple to assemble. Instructions are very clear and every component is clearly marked/labeled. Took roughly 30-40 min.Quality is above and beyond what I expected at this price point. I wasn't exactly expecting something extraordinary, I was just hoping it would be decent enough. But everything feels very solid. No wobble, no squeeks.Great design and the bed looks wonderful! I got the Beige, it looks just as shown in pics. Highly recommend!

Review: Best thing: All bed parts come in one box.Worst thing. All bed parts come in one box. Sorry but this baby is HEAVY. But it appears to be made better than I guess I was expecting. Assembly is easy. Looks great. Honestly say I'm impressed and happy we purchased.

Review: Good Purchase. The bed seems sturdy and looks great for the cost. The assembly was easy enough, took me like an hour or so, and I did it by myself. It is a low height bed which I like. Gave 4 stars as I have not used it yet ü§ì

Review: Purchased this for a spare bedroom. Love the Gray color. Foundation is super sturdy. No real storage space. Very stable and well built by appearance. Again this bed has a lot of stability.  I would recommend it. The price was also great.
