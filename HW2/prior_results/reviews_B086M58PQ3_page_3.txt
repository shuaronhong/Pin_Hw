Review: A few holes were misaligned during installation leading to some unnecessary frustration, longer assembly time, and having to rebuild everything nearly from the beginning. Building quality and color are nice. Easy to move when installed. Pretty comfortable and material of headboard is soft. Smell was not bad considering it was furniture shipped internationally in a box.

Review: Perfect for low budget or guest room. All the bedbug reviews made me nervous. As a precaution I sprayed the head and foot board with alcohol and inspected them really well. No signs of BB.
