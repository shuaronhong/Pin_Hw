Review: This shoe runs narrow. I returned it and ordered the same shoe for a “wide”. I never have to get wide, but this dressy pointed toe pinched my toe. Nicely made  for the price. I will let you know if the wide worked.

Review: Comfortable. Perfect fit . They are truly wide fit and I can wear with or without socks. They can be worn with a variety of clothing. I’m looking forward to purchasing more Amazon Essential products.
