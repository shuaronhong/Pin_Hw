Review: These are the most comfortable shoes you will own.I can't believe how nice these feel on your feet.  Weightless and airy, these are cool shoes!  The best for summer.  I wear them without socks and they are like having nothing on.  I can't say enough about how good they make my feet feel.They are also very stylish, some of the nicest looking shoes.  The color choices do make for a collection, no?  On top of all of that, they are very inexpensive.  So buy a pair and see if I'm right... you'll be glad you did (I own three pair now)Size is true,  the fit perfectly.

Review: Honestly the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn that still look amazing. They are light, breathable, stretchy, and comfortable while fitting pretty much every outfit I've worn them with. Couldn't ask for anything more.

Review: Great shoe for a reasonable price! My son wanted a casual dress shoe to wear to summer weddings. He says they are light weight and comfortable. Size fit as should. He has worn them several times they are a nice shoe

Review: Very nice and lightweight walking shoes. They are very comfortable and well cushioned. I love the style. The only thing is that I disagree with some of the other reviewers who said they run small. Because they are stretchy I need my exact size. GREAT SERVICE... since it didn't fit, they gave me a refund AND a new pair of shoes.

Review: I love the quality and look of these shoes. I have worn them with dress pants as well as casual and they were perfect for the occasions for which I wore them.  They are comfortable too. The size is accurate as compared to other shoes I've purchased.

Review: This is my 3rd pair. I have them in different colors and love the lightweight feeling of them. They are extremely comfortable and so far have held up well. The 9.5 is a little large but still fits well.

Review: These shoes are a great value.  They are incredibly comfortable right out of the box and I am very picky when it comes to that.  I dealt with plantar fasciitis in both feet for 2 years so after that finally resolved, I am extra cautious whenever something doesn't feel perfect.  I normally have to put insoles into brand new shoes because it seems regardless of price, manufacturers are only concerned with appearance.  Not only are these economical and in fact, look great, they are truly comfortable.  You spend your entire life either in bed or on your feet, so don't cheat yourself out of comfortable mattresses or shoes.  In both cases, cost does not equate to comfort and that is especially true in this case.

Review: I had very low expectations when I ordered these shoes. Turns out I was way off the mark with that initial opinion.  When the shoes arrived they looked good,  they felt good and I quickly knew they were keepers.  They were true to size, and they were very comfortable. I wore them to a social event without ever attempting to break them in, and they just felt good, I didn't even notice I was wearing new/never broken in shoes.  I haven't had a pair of white shoes in many years and needed these for a social event.  They absolutely delivered.

Review: Bought these before going on a 3 week European vacation, knowing we would be walking a lot. Nice fit. Very comfortable. Look great with jeans or casual wear.
