Review: My nephew loves them! I would say it is perfect from ages 6 to 12 years of age. Pretty decent size. In my opinion kinda hard to transform. But we just went a looked up a video and it was.much easier after that!

Review: These are cool, but they sure fall apart easily. We have an off-brand set that was cheaper and is much sturdier. I guess I expected them to be better. Definitely do NOT pay $39 for them.
