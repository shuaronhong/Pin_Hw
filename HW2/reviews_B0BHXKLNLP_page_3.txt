Review: These were really perfect for my 5 year old. Easy enough to transform by himself and not cheap plastic.

Review: We bought these for a 3 year old. He was thrilled with them. You just drop them on a table or floor to transform them into cars. He is able to switch them back to robots easily. No small pieces to hunt around for, and they are well made.

Review: We purchased these for our 5 year old grandson.  I was worried about the size - but they are perfect.  My grandson loved them right out of the package.  They are extremely easy to manipulate and they fit well into pockets.  They set of three is great for playing with others.

Review: Cool concept, I liked the idea of easy transforming, especially for my 4 year old to play with and be rough with, since you literally drop the toy to transform. However, the parts are cheap, the arms and wheels fall off, the latches barely work, and the transform function is hit or miss. You get what you pay for, for a few minutes of fun, before they break.

Review: These toys are great for kids who are too young to transform the regular toys. They are spring loaded with small clips that release when you put them down on the release button. Try not to throw them down, we had a couple wheels break off from being rough with them, but they still transform.

Review: You simply flip them and when the hit the floor, they transform back to vehicles.  Make sure and do it on a solid surface, carpet doesn't work well if at all.

Review: I have a 3-year-old with zero patience and low frustration tolerance, so Transformer simplicity was a must. These are ONE step. SO easy for him to do on his own, and highly recommended for a younger Transformer fan.
