Review: Runs big. I usually wear a size 10 wide. These I ordered in a 10 wide and had to reorder in a 9.5 regular, still a little big but fit enough. The color was perfect for what I was looking for. The style is nice and they are comfortable. Shipping was also fast. No high heel to kill my feet at a wedding. I would recommend sizing down a full size.

Review: I bought the Amazon Essentials ballet flats and loved them. Those ran big so sized down a half size and they fit perfectly. Loved them so much I bought this style, bought the same size. For pointed toe they're not bad but not as comfy as the round toe. A little snug sized down so just buy your regular size. If you need to half or full size up sometimes I'd say you could even do that and they'd be more comfortable. Overall cute, comfortable enough, good quality for the price.

Review: I ordered these flats in both chocolate and black microsuede. I got size 8 and they both fit true to size. You can easily dress them up for work or keep it casual with skinny jeans, which is how I usually wear them. They seem to be good quality, especially for $25! They’re decently comfortable, although I have a desk job so I’m sitting the majority of the time I’m wearing them lol.

Review: Love these!! The cheetah color is bold and looks great. I got it in my size and Wide. They are a little loose but still stay on. Maybe next I’ll get regular.

Review: I've bought other shoes from Amazon basics before and liked them, so I had a good idea of the quality to expect (decent but not incredible, lol). This style seems to run a little large, as I ordered my normal size and they're a little too big. But they're the same standard of quality and very comfortable straight from the box, aside from being cute. I recommend them, just be aware that you might want to order a half size down!

Review: Okay so either my little bit of weight loss has changed the Dynamics of my feet, or these shoes run a little big. I purchased these in wide, because a lot of these flats end up being too narrow for my feet. But these ones, there was plenty of room to where the shoes were almost too big. Why they don't tend to fall off my feet when I walk, the fear is there that it's going to happen because they're so loose. My recommendation is if you're kind of in between a regular size shoe and a wide, you may not want to get the wide in this particular shoe. I know that if I buy any other colors in the future I am going to get the regular size and not the wides. Nonetheless it's not so bad that I feel I absolutely have to return these. Just a lesson learned.With that being said I don't see anything, per se, with the quality of the shoe. Of course, I have yet to wear them. They look nice. And they seem comfortable. I purchased the burgundy red ones and they seem to be true to the color advertised.If anything changes regarding my review I will try to remember to come back and update this.

Review: Looks sleek and stylish. Light weight and nice color. Shoe quality is good for occasional wear. The shoe is not very stiff. It may leave folding marks and shoe fits your size. Strechability is good.  I am usually a 9.5 size but it feels loose and has more gaps. So may be buy 1 size smaller.
