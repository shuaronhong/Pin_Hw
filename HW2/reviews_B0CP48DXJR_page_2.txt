Review: These toys are pretty mixed. They're decent looking but have pretty bad posing. They're very easy and fun to transform. They haven't broken at all and they're an alright size, like 5 inches each.I got them for a much lower price and in all honesty, I don't know if full price is fully worth it. But this would be a very good gift for a child or if you just really want a set of all 3 without breaking the bank.In my opinion, they rank:TOPShockwaveStarscreamSoundwaveBOTTOMSoundwave has a gimmick where Laserbeak bursts out his chest and I find it very annoying. It pops out to easy and it's annoying to get back in. Soundwave is also VERY hard to stand up as he has hollow legs with no back. I don't even bother standing him up on my shelf.

Review: I got these for a four year old birthday, while they look like the picture- be warned that there is a lot of steps to transform them and do not throw out the instructions, you will need them to be successful in transforming them. Pieces are smaller than expected and can break off. Overall I would not purchase again.

Review: My 13 year old grandson requested this for Christmas. I won't know if it's a hit or miss until December 25

Review: Two out of the three items have broken parts, and one is partially immobile. I doubt they are worth the cost. This was something the grandson used to play with every day. They lasted less than a month! While he is a boy he is not destructive…

Review: The plastic on these transformers is so much better. There are ball joints which make it easy to transform. My 7yr old grandson had no problem following instructions. Durability is a 5, they are not made for rough play. Good value for the money for imaginative play and good size for travel. Age range 5 to 10 years.

Review: Cheap plastic. Two of the characters’ pieces have started falling within 3 months of purchase.The transformations are easy to do, but the plastic is brittle.
