Review: Quality: good, easy to transform to vehicle except for Soundwave which the front part of the car didn't fit that well. My kids have lots of fun playing with them though.

Review: The toy itself were OK. Since they are only 5 inches they are not really manageable for my 6 yr old grandson. Anytime he tried to transformed them a piece would come out and we had to put it back together. Not really the best for transforming.

Review: The quality is medium to medium high.. They’re a little difficult to transform but once they’re transformed, they seem OK.  The reason I took the one star off his shots because I think they’re a little difficult to transform based on the age group.  I would still try it But I would be close by just so they don’t get frustrated trying to transform
