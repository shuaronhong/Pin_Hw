Review: This is my second pair of these, and I could not be happier. I wear them everywhere and they are the most comfortable shoe I have. I would absolutely buy them again. The fit is great and they leave my feet feeling great at the end of the day.

Review: My teenager said these were the most comfortable dress shoes.  Yes they look really large in the picture because they are a size 14, so they are really large.  Since we have to order all shoes, we order 5 or 6 pairs at a time, he try's them on and then we send the others back.  I bought shoes at several price points including a pair of Cole Haans and he liked these the most.  He also needed a black pair and ask if I could get the same kind.  I'm not sure how they will hold up over time but they are perfect for prom, a wedding, and things of that nature.
