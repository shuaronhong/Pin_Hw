Review: Very light weight with excellent cushion and support. Very stylish. I bought them primarily for trip where we'll be walking a lot and having dinners requiring more than tennis shoes. These will allow me to wear for both.

Review: These shoes are great for using as my shoe for my puppet ministry performances.  I tried to wear them with out tying the laces, but instead tucking them in the sides for the shoes.  That worked ok, but not as well as I expected.  The shoes are pretty comfortable and lightweight.  I would, probably buy them again.
