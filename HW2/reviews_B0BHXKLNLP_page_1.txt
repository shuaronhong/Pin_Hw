Review: These 1-Step Flip Heroes are an absolute blast! The flip-to-transform feature is both innovative and entertaining—just toss them in the air, and they land transformed. It's a hit with the kids and brings a nostalgic smile to adults too. The set includes Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Wheeljack, each detailed and sturdy. Perfect for quick play sessions or as a fun desk distraction. Highly recommend for Transformers fans of all ages!​

Review: These Transformer toys are my son's absolute favorite toys EVER!!!  If you are on the fence about buying them, just buy them!  You will not regret it.  My son is 3.5 years old and they are very easy to transform from AutoBot to car.  He now takes them to sleep with him haha!!

Review: Mother of two 6 year olds. I’ve bought and returned multiple transformers and this is the only one we’re keeping. It’s super easy to transform, doesn’t break, rather small but that’s okay. My kids struggled with the complicated process of all the other cheaper transformers

Review: My son loves these.  He has so many transformers that he struggles to transform but these are so easy.  You literally throw it and it converts to a car, that his favorite feature.  It’s so easy they are almost a perfect fidget tool to keep handy.  I would also add that they are a good size to fit in your purse and have handy for those “the kid needs a toy or there will be a meltdown” moments.

Review: I got these for my son for Christmas. I always check the box to make sure everything is there and good. The box was damaged. I checked inside and the toys thankfully were all there and work well, but the inside packaging had been opened before. I'm not sure if I got something someone returned? A little strange since I'm buying "new" but my son will be happy with the toys so it's not a big deal. Just odd.

Review: These were bought as a gift for an 8yo . He loves them! They work exactly as described and since they're meant to be dropped- they aren't super fragile.  So far they are still going strong and have lasted 2 days in a house with 5 little boys.  I would buy these again.  Actually,  heading to look for more right now so that all of the boys have some to play with!
