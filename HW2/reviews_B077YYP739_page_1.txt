Review: My 5 year old grandson liked this so much that he brought it to bed with him the day he got it.  He woke up the next morning with his arms around it and a big smile on his face!  This toy has brought him endless joy!  It was easy to figure out and easy to transform. It appears to be a hardy toy and well made.

Review: I bought this toy for my transformers obsessed 4 year old son. It took him some time to figure out how to transform the robot into the truck in 6 “easy” steps. He enjoys it a lot. I think overall it’s a good toy

Review: Why did you pick this product vs others?:Transformers brand is a must!  Popular character that even I knew (70 yrs).  Also, was a specific request.  I really like that this was made for a little younger or less skillful kids.  It was a great birthday present for a 6 yr. old.

Review: Super cool toy, but it hard at times to convert it from transformer to vehicle. A little confusing for my 4 year old. Durable, and comes with no accessories

Review: Bought for my 3 year old son. Great quality heavy duty plastic. Would be hard for a younger kid to switch back and forth from action figure to vehicle but not advertised for younger kids so still great product.
